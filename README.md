# Security Essentials
## In this course I acquired fundamental knowledge and skills required to assist with cybersecurity operations and practices. I learned about various potential threats and attacks. Implemented solutions to mitigate risks. Applied monitoring and assessment techniques to networks, applications, host devices, and cloud solutions. I learned the importance of data ownership and regulations. I respond to incidents and conducted analysis.
### In this activity, I used common network tools, such as local commands and the Nmap network mapper, to discover other hosts on the local network. Next, I conducted a banner grabbing exercise to identify specific services on the hosts. Finally, I used DNS tools to gather name resolution information.
