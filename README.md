## In this course I acquired fundamental knowledge and skills required to assist with cybersecurity operations and practices. I learned about various potential threats and attacks. Implemented solutions to mitigate risks. Applied monitoring and assessment techniques to networks, applications, host devices, and cloud solutions. I learned the importance of data ownership and regulations. I respond to incidents and conducted analysis.
### Determined the configuration of a local host and it's subnet, using tools such as ifconfig, ip, arp, netdiscover, and pathping. These scans were run from a KALI Linux VM and Windows Server.
